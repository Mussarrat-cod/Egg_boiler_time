# 🥚 Egg Boiling Timer ⏰
This is a **super simple** (but kinda cool) web-based timer to help you boil eggs perfectly – whether you like 'em soft, medium, or hard. Built using plain ol' **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
## 💡 What it Does?
Just pick your style:
- 🐣 Soft-boiled  
- 🥚 Medium-boiled  
- 🧱 Hard-boiled
Hit the button and boom – countdown starts! When it's done, you'll hear a sound (if you’ve got it turned on 😅).
## 🎨 Tech Used
- HTML (the skeleton)
- CSS (made it a bit cute)
- JavaScript (so it actually works)
## 🚀 Try it Locally
Just download the files and open `index.html` in your browser. 
No rocket science.
git clone https://github.com/your-username/egg-timer-boi.git
or just download the ZIP. Whatever floats your boat 🛶.

🙃 Why I Made This?
Idk, I was hungry and learning JS. 😂
